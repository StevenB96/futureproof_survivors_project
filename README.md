# futureproof_survivors_project

**Description:**

The aim of this project is to create a web app that allows people who are struggling to find employment to:

 - Create a digital CV

 - Access a job coach

## Requirements:

**About:**

Because the web app is designed for people who may have issues working through certain tasks, there will be a clear explanation of the concept behind the web app. There will also be a clear set of instructions for using the app.

**Registration/login page:**

There will be a registration page which collects necessary information about the user. There will also be a login page.

**Digital CV builder:**

Users will be able to add to the standard digital CV layout. This will involve choosing a number of additional sections, as well as their type.

Sections will be implemented as tabs. Clicking on a tab will present the user with a page that will allow them to CRUD content in that section.

Users will be able to retroactively add or remove sections (i.e. tabs) from their digital CV.

**Job coaching:**

When a digital CV is submitted, it will automatically be sent to the job coaching team by email.

The job coaching team will then contact the user with potential revisions and present the user with an action plan for finding employment.

Users will have the option of manually submitting their digital CV to an employer by email.

**Settings:**

Users will have the ability to change their name, password and contact details.

## On boarding to the project:

This project is effectively a fork of another project written in PHP. For that reason this project will also be primarily written in PHP. However, whereas the original project was written entirely in vanilla, to progress further with this one we will leverage the Laravel framework. Beyond that the specification is quite open.
